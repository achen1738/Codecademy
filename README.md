A frontend only web-app I made for Codecademy. A simple UI with a light and dark mode that displays cards. You can view it using this link

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
